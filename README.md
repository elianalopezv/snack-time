# Snack Time! :hamburger:
A delicious runner game.

## 1. Story of Snack Time!

This game has a real story.
A software company called Yuxi Global gives a delicious prize to their employees on every end of week: the friday snack.

Eating this snack is really exquisite, but catch one can be dangerous. You must be the fastest dude to get to the kitchenette!
But you will need to avoid any obstacle in your way. Carefully, off course. Otherwise, you will at the end of an endless queue.
You don't want that! you're starving.

Like many companies for these days, this one wants to make feel their employees like super-heroes!
That's why the main character is the quickest super-hero you may know.

By the way. The main purpose of this game wasn't just see what happens in the Yuxi headquarters on every Friday.
What I wanted to do with this idea, actually was to show to all my coworkers that we could make fun videogames in Yuxi too.

Together with the game, I decided to prepare a presentation for all of them with the basics of game development with Unity.

## 2. How does Snack Time! look?

Let's start the game from the main screen. You'll only need to click or tap to jump. 
But, don't underestimate these simple controls. The speed of the game can be very challenging.

Along the way you will need to jump over typical office obstacles. Yes, there are some puffs to take a nap at the office too.

Don't crash with the obstacles or you'll be out of the game. And even worse, without your food :(

But if you are a great runner like Flash, and you finally get to the kitchenette... Oh yeah, celebration time! (with delicious food).
